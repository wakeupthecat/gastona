      // --- To program or not to program, that is the question. ---
      //
      // The development of Graphic User Interface applications (GUI) using languages like C, C++ or java
      // are, in general arduous and the final results are, since they are compiled languages, quite
      // inflexible. Furthermore most of the times the code needed is quite repetitive by always using
      // the same mechanics (e.g. fill this list, get that selected value, etc..). 
      //
      // But why is so hard to program GUI parts ? As a matter of fact, many typical GUI requirements are 
      // expressed easily using few sentences, making it hard to believe that its realization can take so 
      // much effort. So, it would not be nice being able to build the GUI part just typing almost only 
      // some key words of that sentences (e.g. label, button, list) ?
      //
      // Regarding the logic many scripting languages have also demonstrated the weakness of these compiled
      // languages in tasks like parsing, text generation, batch processing, etc.., which are very often
      // needed in applications and tools.
      //
      // Yet another kind of language, SQL, solves in a natural way many typical tasks that a GUI application
      // might need like sorting lists, searching items, filtering and many other problematics which solution
      // in an algorithmic way result expensive in all senses. So again, it would not be nice being able
      // to use SQL as part of the scripting language out of the box ?
      //
      // The approach of Gastona is not to be a complete language but to cover the gaps mentioned
      // through a mini-script language, but still having the possibility to program functionality
      // in another language when this appears to be the best choice. In other words, just program
      // what has to be programmed and for the rest use configuration, scripting and SQL.
      //
      // Using Gastona many applications can be developed without programming a solely line of
      // code in java. For example this WelcomeGastona including the generation of the documentation
      // has been made using only Gastona scripts.
      //
      // The syntax employed for gastona uses extensively a simple separated comma structure 
      // that make it different from any other language or script. Its unfamiliar look can make 
      // the impression that it learn it should be hard but actually for a person with no programming 
      // knowledge at all might be probably the easiest thing to learn.
      //
      // For this reason, and not uninterestingly, gastona might attract initially the attention of people either 
      // with no or less knowledge in programming languages or with a lot of it but not of the big majority.
      //
      // Hopefully gastona would help to demystify GUI development and SQL language making them
      // closer to many people that, knowing what they want from an application, are not able
      // to achieve its development using other more complex languages.
