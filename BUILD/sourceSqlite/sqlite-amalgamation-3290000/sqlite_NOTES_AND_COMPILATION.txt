===== SOURCE CODE FOR sqltite

These are the original sqlite3 3.29 taken from sqlite.org sqlite-amalgamation-3290000

      shell.c, sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c

We do modify shell.c and name it shell_modified.c in order to add a new
function called "samefilecontent" that compares a field of type blob with
a file from file system

===== COMPILATION

on windows
gcc -O2 shell_modified.c sqlite3.c -o sqlite329.exe

on linux and linux arm
gcc -O2 shell_modified.c sqlite3.c -o sqlite3.29 -lpthread -ldl


===== COPY BINARIES BEFORE BUILDING gastona.jar

   the binaries (e.g. sqlite329.exe) has to be placed in
   the directory META-GASTONA\muTools + right platform subfolder

   for example for the windows binary

      META-GASTONA\muTools\winOS\sqlite

   Note: right now only windows is updated to the version 3.29
         while other platforms (arm, linux) are using 3.17
         for no special reason but its compilation has not been done yet ...
